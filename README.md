#Description
###What is this programm doing?
This programm reads all 15 minutes a CSV-File in the CSV-File are tire-informations which are really mixed up. The information in the file must be in a special order so the Online-Shop can import the informations and is able to interpretate the information right and make from the informations a product. So our programm edits and orders the informations and writes it in a new CSV-File.

###Background
The new CSV-File is going to be uploaded to our Server where our Online-Shop imports them und update all 15 minutes the new tire informations. In our Online-Shop the different tire-informations are absolut defined. That means the first colummn in the csv files is for example the Thumbnail-Picture and the second is the Article Name and so on.
